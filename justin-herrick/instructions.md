#Hello Students#

Your assignment is to:
  * Fork this repo on github (__you have already done this__)
  * Clone your forked repo onto your local machine
  * Create a folder with your name
  * Inside that folder create a single page website that explains how to use any CSS3 property with 2 examples

  * You can choose between:
    * css animations
    * css transitions
    * css 'calc' feature
    * css :before, :after
    * css gradients
    * css border images
    * css columns
    * css 3d transforms

  * Your website should be short, but should be enough that someone else in the class should be able to read it and know enough to use that feature themselves. Think of it as a very short tutorial.
  * Everyone _must_ pick a different item, so collaborate between yourselves.
  * No external resources or libraries


  * Once your changes are finished (__and committed__) you will then push them to github
  * Then go back to the assignment repo and create a pull request
