			CSS gradients are rad. You can do some pretty neat things with them :)
		</p>
		<p>
			Gradients are usually displayed as one color that fades into another. With CSS3 you can control every aspect of how that happens, from the direction to the colors (as many colors as you want) to where those color changes happen. In the same way that the background of an element can be declared to be a certain color in CSS (e.g. "background-color: #ecf0f1;"), the background can be declared to be a gradient.

		<p>
			Gradients can be done in two ways:
			<li>Linear</li>
			<li>Radial</li>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Linear</strong> gradients can go up, down, left, right, or diagonally. <strong>Radial</strong> gradients are defined by where their center point is located. I will show an example of each below:
